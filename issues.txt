/* Issues:
- you can make a relative link to the file for a class but not the content.  The difference is 
	that, when you link the file, the file will load in the iframe but the rest of the page 
	will still reflect the original content.  So, hyperlinks to the content will break if taken 
	out of context.
- hideEmptyTables needs to check both the primary and secondary pages for content -- right
	now it is just checking primary (I think - not tested)
- change [pre] in code only if it does not have its own class already

- instructors still have to put in hash tag hyperlinks in HTML
  -- set an ID and do in JS
- change absolute links in D2L back to relative links
- D2L autogenerates figcaptions
- test script and css in header: does the link change in file or just when loaded by D2L?
- D2L <span> does allow for classes inside
- black <address> lines do not show in the editor
- get rid of JQuery in this script
- sk to save changes in D2L Editor
- set width of table to content
- float tables and code in print
- insert lessons 

Change styles for:
1) an inline section <span>
2) a single block item <p>
3) several block items <p>...<p>
4) a whole section

Why <br> should not be used (including <pre>)

- check if in D2L before doing previous and next links

Change figcaption to a <p> with class "caption" -- could have JS change into a <figcaption>
